10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
    Integrating Git with VS Code for Version Control
Initializing a Repository
Install Git: First, I ensure Git is installed on my Windows system by downloading it from git-scm.com and following the installation instructions.

Open VS Code: I open Visual Studio Code and navigate to my project folder by selecting File > Open Folder.

Open Integrated Terminal: Inside VS Code, I press `Ctrl+`` (backtick) to open the integrated terminal at the bottom of the window.

Initialize Git Repository: In the integrated terminal, I type:

csharp
Copy code
git init
This command initializes a new Git repository in my project folder.

Making Commits
Stage Changes: As I make changes to my project files, VS Code automatically detects these changes in the Source Control view (Ctrl+Shift+G).

Stage Changes: I click the + icon next to each modified file in the Source Control view to stage them for the commit. Alternatively, I can stage all changes by clicking ... (three dots) and selecting Stage All Changes.

Commit Changes: In the textbox at the top of the Source Control view, I enter a descriptive commit message summarizing the changes. Then, I press Ctrl+Enter or click the checkmark icon to commit the changes.

Pushing Changes to GitHub
Create a Repository on GitHub: I navigate to GitHub in my web browser, log in (if necessary), and create a new repository with an appropriate name and description.

Add Remote Repository: Back in the VS Code integrated terminal, I add the remote repository URL obtained from GitHub by typing:

csharp
Copy code
git remote add origin repository_url
Here, repository_url is the URL copied from GitHub.

Push Changes: Finally, I push my committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub using:
git push -u origin master
perl
Copy code
git push -u origin master
This command pushes my local master branch changes to the remote repository. If I'm working on a different branch, I replace master with the branch name.

Additional Git Operations in VS Code
Viewing Changes: I use the Source Control view (Ctrl+Shift+G) in VS Code to review file changes, compare versions, and discard changes if needed.

Branching: To work on different features or experiments, I create and manage branches directly from the Source Control view in VS Code.

Pulling Changes: I fetch and pull changes from remote repositories using VS Code’s integrated Git features to keep my local repository up-to-date with changes made by collaborators.

 Submission Guidelines:
